# Greyat Labs: Security & Systems Research

Greyat Labs is a personal initiative focused on low-level system security, digital forensics, and secure software development. This repository serves as a documentation hub for my research into system vulnerabilities and recovery.

### Key Areas of Focus:
* **System Recovery:** Researching BIOS-level lock bypasses and non-destructive data retrieval for lost credentials.
* **Digital Privacy:** Exploring encryption standards and secure communication protocols.
* **Web Security:** Hardening WordPress environments and analyzing CMS vulnerabilities.
* **Infrastructure:** Developing guidelines for low-budget, high-efficiency secure computing environments.

### Current Research:
- Analyzing Bitcoin protocol security for the Summer of Bitcoin 2026 application.
- Documenting bypass logic for legacy PC firmware.
